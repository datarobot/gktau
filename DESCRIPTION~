Authors@R: person("Ron", "Pearson", email = "ron@datarobot.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package supports association analysis between categorical
    variables using the Goodman and Kruskal tau measure. This asymmetric association
    measure allows the detection of asymmetric relations between categorical
    variables (e.g., one variable obtained by re-grouping another). This package
    also implements the better known (symmetric) Cramer V measure.
